# Website

This repository contains a simple, minimalist **Daily Blog** website designed to showcase daily posts in a clean and professional layout. It serves as a starting point for anyone wanting to maintain a personal or project-related blog with a minimal codebase.

## 🌐 Project Overview

- **Purpose**: Provide a lightweight template for a daily entry blog with a modern look and responsive design.
- **Structure**:
  - `index.html` – Main landing page that lists blog posts and navigation.
  - `style.css` – Stylesheet with reset rules and layout/styles for the blog.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone or download this directory to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser to view the blog.
3. Modify or add new `<section class="post">` elements in `index.html` to create additional posts.
4. Adjust styles in `style.css` for custom branding or color schemes.

## 🛠️ Customization

- Update the navigation links in the header to point to actual pages (About, Contact, etc.).
- Replace placeholder post content with real entries or dynamically generate via a build process.
- Enable responsive enhancements or add JavaScript for interactivity if desired.

## 📄 License
